          <p>
            <strong>Rock and roll</strong>, also called rock ’n’ roll or rock &
            roll, is a style of popular music that was originated in the United
            States in the mid-1950s and that evolved by the mid-1960s into the
            more encompassing international style known as rock music, though
            the latter also continued to be known as rock and roll.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rock and roll has been described as a merger of country music and
            rhythm and blues, were that simple, it would have existed long
            before it burst into the national consciousness. The seeds of the
            music had been in place for decades, but they flowered in the
            mid-1950s when nourished by a volatile mix of Black culture and
            white spending power.
          </p>

          <p>
            By the mid-1960s this sophistication allowed the music greater
            freedom than ever before, and it fragmented into numerous styles
            that became known simply as rock.
          </p>

          <p>
            For sixty years, conventional wisdom has told us that women
            generally did not perform rock and roll during the 1950s.
          </p>

          <p>
            In every decade, you can find someone commenting on the absence of
            women on the charts during rock and roll’s heyday. Others note that
            women during that era were typically not so inclined to a wild,
            raucous style.
          </p>

          <p>
            The reality is, however, that hundreds — or maybe thousands — of
            women and girls performed and recorded rock and roll in its early
            years. And many more participated in other ways: writing songs,
            owning or working for record labels, working as session or touring
            musicians, designing stage wear, dancing, or managing talent — to
            give just a few examples.
